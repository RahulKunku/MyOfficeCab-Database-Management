# MyOfficeCab Data Management Project

## Overview

This project involves the development and implementation of a structured and centralized Database Management System (DBMS) for MyOfficeCab, an eco-transportation company in India. The goal is to enhance the efficiency of data management, streamline ETL processes, and unlock valuable insights for better decision-making.

## Project Goals and Objectives

### Goals
- Efficiently manage data related to customers, transactions, fleet management, and employee details.
- Provide a digitalized and centralized database to replace offline data management methods.

### Objectives
- Develop a structured and centralized DBMS using SQL.
- Enhance information management and streamline ETL processes.
- Generate insights on key metrics like month-on-month trips, top drivers, busiest days of the week, and high-demand areas.
- Identify high-profit segments and channels.

## Database Design

### Tables and Datasets
The project utilizes six main tables:
1. **Employees**: Stores details like employee ID, name, gender, email, contact information, and active status.
2. **Employee_Trips**: Records employee trip details, including pickup date and time.
3. **Employee_Offices**: Maps employees to their corresponding offices.
4. **Trips**: Contains data on all trips, including driver and vehicle details.
5. **Vehicles**: Includes vehicle information such as model, registration number, status, and insurance details.
6. **Drivers**: Stores driver details, including name, license expiry date, and contact information.
7. **Customers**: Contains customer details and office locations.

### Relationships
- Each employee can take multiple trips, and each trip can involve multiple employees.
- Each trip is managed by one driver but can involve multiple vehicles.
- Each employee is assigned to one office, but an office can have multiple employees.
- Each customer is linked to multiple offices.

## Conceptual and Relational Data Models

The database design includes conceptual (ERD) and relational data models to illustrate the relationships between different entities and tables.

## SQL Queries and Insights

### Key Queries
1. **Month-On-Month Number of Trips**: Tracks the total trips taken each month.
    ```sql
    SELECT CONCAT(RIGHT(trip_date, 4), '-', LEFT(trip_date, 2)) AS "Year_Month", COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Trips
    FROM trips
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1;
    ```
2. **Month-On-Month Number of Employees**: Counts the number of employees taking trips each month.
    ```sql

    FROM employee_trips
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1;
    ```
3. **Month-On-Month Top Drivers**: Identifies the top drivers based on the number of trips completed each month.

    ```

### Insights
- **Busiest Days**: Wednesday and Thursday are the busiest days.
- **Peak Times**: 12 PM to 3 PM and 9 PM to Midnight are the busiest times.
- **Trip Volume**: August 2022 saw the highest number of trips (1714).
- **Insurance Coverage**: ~28% of rides were in partially insured vehicles, suggesting an opportunity to upgrade to full coverage.

### Future Recommendations
1. **Process Optimization**: Automate billing processes to reduce manual effort.
2. **Expansion**: Scale operations to onboard more clients and manage data more efficiently.
3. **Feedback System**: Introduce a feedback table for driver ratings and punctuality to improve service quality.

## Conclusion

The implementation of a centralized DBMS for MyOfficeCab significantly enhances data management capabilities, providing valuable insights and supporting data-driven decision-making. This project sets a foundation for further improvements and scalability in MyOfficeCabâ€™s operations.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all date fields are formatted as `mm/dd/yyyy` when uploading data to use the queries in their current format.
- Execute schema SQL scripts before running the query scripts to avoid data inconsistencies.
